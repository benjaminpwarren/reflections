When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you're collaborating with other people, or happen to be using another computer. Also, it's cheap backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because remote changes by others could overwrite the work you've done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A branch is a 'splitting' internal to the repository.
  A clone is a copy of a repository.
  A fork is a clone, but done via the GitHub servers, and maintaining a connection to the original repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  A local copy of a the last remote state is helpful if you're going to be without internet access for a period.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  Email, Dropbox, LAN.

  Saving a file would be easier, you wouldn't have to think about whether to commit it or not. However, merging and change tracking would be much more manual and labour-intensive.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  When collaborating with others, changing the master directly means things can change underneath them.
